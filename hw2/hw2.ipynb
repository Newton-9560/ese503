This class offers a detailed look into the dynamics of component replacement, including the calculation of lifetimes, replacement times, and the overall efficiency of the system.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### `get_replece_time(self, low=25, high=35)`\n",
    "- Determines the time required to replace a component, drawing from a uniform distribution between specified low and high values, in minutes.\n",

    "#### `simulate(self)`\n",
    "- Orchestrates the simulation process, generating lifetimes and replacement times for components, and calculating the key metrics of the simulation, such as start and end times for replacements, and actual lifetimes considering a maximum cap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "An instance of `Problem2` is created with 100 simulations to be performed. The simulation runs 10 iterations to collect data on replacement times and lifetimes. After each iteration, the results are aggregated into lists for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis and Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average Total Time:** The average end time of the last replacement across all simulations, converted to hours, provides insight into the total operational duration.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Average Number of Replacements in First Five Days:** This metric calculates how many components need replacement within the first five days of operation, offering a measure of component durability and the frequency of maintenance required.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Average Component Usage Time:** The mean time a component is used before replacement gives an idea of component lifespan and efficiency.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Machine Idle Time Percentage:** This calculation shows the proportion of time the machine is not operational due to replacements, highlighting the efficiency and downtime of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This detailed simulation and analysis through the `Problem2` class provide valuable insights into the operational efficiency, component durability, and maintenance needs of the system. By adjusting parameters and running multiple simulations, one can optimize the system for better performance and reduced downtime.\n"

    "The `Problem4` class is designed to simulate a service system, such as a queue in a bank or a restaurant, focusing on customer interarrival and service times during different parts of the day. It provides a detailed analysis of customer wait times, service efficiency, and system idle times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features and Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization (`__init__`)**: Sets up probability distributions for customer interarrival times for morning and afternoon, as well as service times, to closely mimic real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Time Selection (`get_time`)**: Dynamically selects a random time for a given category (morning, afternoon, or service) based on the associated probability distributions. It ensures variability in the simulation, reflecting the randomness of real service systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Arrival Time Calculation (`get_arrival_time`)**: Generates a sequential list of customer arrival times throughout the operational day, transitioning from morning to afternoon schedules. This method models the fluctuating customer flow that many service systems experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simulation Execution (`simulate`)**: Conducts the core simulation, tracking wait times, service initiation and completion times, and periods of inactivity. It offers a comprehensive view of the operational dynamics, including how long customers wait, how long they spend in the system, and the efficiency of the service provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon executing the `simulate` method, the class yields several key metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability of Customer Wait**: Indicates how frequently customers need to wait in line before receiving service. This metric helps assess the demand and supply balance within the service system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average Wait Time**: Provides the mean duration that customers wait in line, offering insights into service accessibility and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average Wait Time for Waiting Customers**: Focuses on customers who actually waited, giving a deeper understanding of the wait experience for those not immediately served.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average Time Spent in System**: Calculates the total time customers spend in the system, combining both wait and service times. This metric reflects the overall customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Server Idle Fraction**: Measures the proportion of operational time the server remains idle, indicating the system's utilization and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Daily Customer Volume**: Counts the number of customers entering the system within a day, helping in capacity planning and staffing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Through its simulation, `Problem4` offers valuable insights into the operational efficiency of service systems, highlighting areas for improvement in customer service and resource allocation. By analyzing wait times, service durations, and idle times, stakeholders can make informed decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.\n"
